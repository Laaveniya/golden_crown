## Problem Statement
Shan, the gorilla king of the Space kingdom wants to rule all Six Kingdoms in the universe of Southeros.

There is no ruler in the universe of Southeros and pandemonium reigns. He needs the support of 3 more kingdoms to be the ruler.

Each kingdom has an animal emblem and Shan needs to send a message with the animal in the message to win them over. LAND emblem - Panda, WATER emblem - Octopus, ICE emblem - Mammoth, AIR emblem - Owl, FIRE emblem - Dragon.

Once he wins 3 more kingdoms, he is the ruler! The secret message needs to contain the letters of the animal in their emblem. For example, secret message to the Land kingdom (emblem: Panda) needs to have the letter 'p','n','d' at- least once and 'a' at-least twice. If he sends "a1d22n333a4444p" to the Land kingdom, he will win them over.
